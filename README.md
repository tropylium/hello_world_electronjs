# hello_world_electronjs
Getting started with ElectronJS. Just the provided starter project, with a few modifications.

See [this](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start)

My added modifications include using a custom font (Lato), making the CSS prettier and a few javascript event listeners.
